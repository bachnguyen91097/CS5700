High-level approach:
    For this project 1 (Socket Basics), I basically started learning about how to write basic network code,
    which includes setting up the client and connect it with the provided server. Then once I resolved that one
    ,I started figuring out way to process server's response (evaluate the expression using the builtin method
    eval) and then making sure that the client can send proper message to the server and the client can receive
    responses from the server as expected. The final step after making sure that all the logic is correct, is that
    I need to find out the way to call the program using the required command (./client ...).

Challenges:
    - A major one is to figure out how to write proper network code since I have never done this before (a couple
    of googling and asking TAs/professor via Team and Piazza helps a ton. Thanks you guys so much)
    - Making sure that the program can only be run by the correct executing command, which involves a lot of try/
    catch block
    - Figuring out how to write the Makefile in order to resolve "Permission error", also learn that we can make
    a Python file executable by removing the ".py" part and adding a "shebang" line at the top of the file

Testing:
    - Can run the program with the proper command line (split out the secret flag or not?)
    - Try to mess up with the command call and see if it works as expected.
